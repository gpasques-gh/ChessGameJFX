Here is a basic chess game made in JavaFX 11 and Java 21, currently working on it.
- It would have all the basics of a chess game with a basic board GUI
- It is mostly a project for a better understanding of Java and IntelliJ for studies, nothing specially ambitious or complex
- If I learn about the minmax algorithm and can try to implement it in it for trying out an AI, I might do it
- You can come with ideas and corrections for bad approaches, bugs, simpler solutions, you're welcome!
